This project provides three implementations and a verified model of the BitAlloc memory allocator:

* **original** — the original implementation
* **verified_impl** — the Verus-verified implementation
* **verified_proof** — the Verus-verified model
* **optimized** — the optimized implementation rebuilt based on performance analysis and integration constrains
